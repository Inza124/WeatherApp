# Windows Forms Weather Application
This is one of the first programs written by me in C#. I was planning to make it a desktop program, so I decided on windows forms. I just learned the language so I did not decide on WPF. Program used with Yahoo Weather API. The program downloads weather data for my hometown and the surrounding area.

## General info
The program has two basic functionalities. One is a weather forecast for a few days, the other is a map preview with the current weather of the nearest area. This helps to set the current weather for the next few hours. The program interface works in Polish. However, some information may be in English because I did not translate all messages returned by yahoo
